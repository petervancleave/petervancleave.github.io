Customize the menu - 

In order to add/edit/delete entries in the home page, you can copy the `home.yml` file inside `_data` folder. Through that file you can define the structure of the menu and add data for navbar, footer, portfolio or simply remove all of that and use simple blog layout. Take a look at the default configuration to get an idea of how it works and read on for a more comprehensive explaination.

The `home.yml` file accepts the following fields:

1. Vertical list
  - `entries` define a new unordered list that will contain menu entries
  - each entry is marked by a `-` at the beginning of the line
  - each entry has the following attributes:
    - `title`, which defines the text to render for that menu entry
    - `url`, which can either be a URL or `false`. If it is `false`, the entry will be rendered as plain text; otherwise the entry will be rendered as a link pointing to the specified URL. Note that the URL can either be relative or absolute.
    - `post_list`, which can be `true` or `false`. If it is true, the entry will have all posts in the site as subentries. This is used to render your post list.
    - `entries`, yes, you can have entries inside entries. In this way you can create nested sublists!
2. Card list - cards are used to showcase portfolio projects. Please see `project_entries` in `_data/home.yml` file
  - each entry is marked by a `-` at the beginning of the line
  - each entry has the following attributes:
    - `title` defines the header of the card
    - `desc` is the body of the card
    - `url` is a relative or absolute link which this card can point to.
    - `highlight` in case you want to highlight something, keep the text short though
3. Horizontal list - moonwalk uses horizontal lists to create navbar and footer. Please see `navbar_entries` and `footer_entries` in `data/home.yml` file
  - each entry is marked by a `-` at the beginning of the line
  - each entry has the following attributes:
    - `title` defines the header of the card
    - `url` is a relative or absolute link which this card can point to.


1. 3 in-built layouts:
  - post - for content
  - blog - for listing blog posts
  - home - for landing page
  you can change your `index.md` file to use either home or blog layout.

2. It is extremely easy to tweak the color scheme.
