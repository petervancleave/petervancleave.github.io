# Guide to the `pwd` Command in Linux

## Introduction

The `pwd` (print working directory) command in Linux is used to display the absolute path of the current working directory. This is a fundamental command for navigation.

## Basic Syntax

The syntax of the `pwd` command is:

```bash
pwd [OPTIONS]
```

If no options are used, `pwd` simply prints the full path of the current directory.

## Common Usage

### 1. Displaying the Current Directory

```bash
pwd
```

- Prints the absolute path of the current working directory.

### 2. Avoiding Symbolic Links (`-P`)

```bash
pwd -P
```

- Displays the physical directory path, resolving any symbolic links.

### 3. Showing the Logical Path (`-L`)

```bash
pwd -L
```

- Displays the logical path, including symbolic links, based on how you navigated.

## Differences Between `-P` and `-L`

If you navigate through a symbolic link, `pwd -L` shows the symlink path, while `pwd -P` resolves it to the actual directory.

### Example:

```bash
cd /home/user/symlink_folder
pwd -L  # Output: /home/user/symlink_folder
pwd -P  # Output: /home/user/actual_folder
```

## Practical Usage

### 1. Using `pwd` in Scripts

- `pwd` is useful in shell scripts to determine the working directory dynamically.

### Example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "The current directory is: $(pwd)"
```

### 2. Storing the Current Directory in a Variable

```bash
CURRENT_DIR=$(pwd)
echo "Your location is: $CURRENT_DIR"
```

- Saves the working directory path to a variable for later use.

### 3. Navigating and Confirming the Directory

```bash
cd /var/log
pwd
```

- Moves to `/var/log` and confirms the current location.

## **Beginner Activity: Basic Usage of `pwd`**

### **Objective:** Learn the basic function of the `pwd` command and understand absolute paths.

### **Steps:**

1. Open a terminal in your Linux environment.
2. Type the following command and press Enter:
    
    ```bash
    pwd
    ```
    
3. Observe the output, which should display the absolute path of your current directory.
4. Use the `ls` command to list the contents of the current directory:
    
    ```bash
    ls
    ```
    
5. Navigate to a different directory, such as `Documents`, using:
    
    ```bash
    cd Documents
    ```
    
6. Run `pwd` again to check your new location.
7. **Challenge:** Use `cd ..` to move up one directory and verify the change with `pwd`.

## **Intermediate Activity: Exploring Absolute and Relative Paths**

### **Objective:** Understand the difference between absolute and relative paths using `pwd`.

### **Steps:**

1. Navigate to the `/usr` directory using an absolute path:
    
    ```bash
    cd /usr
    ```
    
2. Run `pwd` to verify your location.
3. Move into the `bin` directory using a relative path:
    
    ```bash
    cd bin
    ```
    
4. Again, use `pwd` to display your current directory.
5. Navigate back to your home directory using:
    
    ```bash
    cd ~
    ```
    
6. Use `pwd` once more to confirm that you are in your home directory.
7. **Challenge:** Create a new directory inside `Documents`, move into it, and verify your path with `pwd`.

## **Advanced Activity: Scripting with `pwd`**

### **Objective:** Use `pwd` in a script to enhance workflow automation.

### **Steps:**

1. Open a terminal and create a new script file:
    
    ```bash
    nano directory_check.sh
    ```
    
2. Add the following script to the file:
    
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "You are currently in: $(pwd)"
    ```
    
3. Save and exit (Ctrl + X, then Y, then Enter).
4. Grant execution permission to the script:
    
    ```bash
    chmod +x directory_check.sh
    ```
    
5. Run the script:
    
    ```bash
   ./directory_check.sh
    ```
    
6. **Challenge:** Modify the script to log the output of `pwd` into a file named `directory_log.txt` each time it is run.
