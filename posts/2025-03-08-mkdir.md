# Guide to the `mkdir` Command in Linux

## Introduction

The `mkdir` (make directory) command in Linux is used to create new directories. 

## Basic Syntax

The syntax of the `mkdir` command is:

```bash
mkdir [OPTIONS] DIRECTORY_NAME
```

- `[OPTIONS]` – Optional flags to modify the command’s behavior.
- `DIRECTORY_NAME` – Name of the directory to be created.

## Common Usage

### 1. Creating a Single Directory

```bash
mkdir folder1
```

- Creates a directory named `myfolder` in the current location.

### 2. Creating Multiple Directories

```bash
mkdir dir1 dir2 dir3
```

- Creates multiple directories at once.

### 3. Creating Parent Directories (`-p`)

```bash
mkdir -p parent/child/grandchild
```

- Creates a nested directory structure.
- If `parent` does not exist, it is created automatically.

### 4. Setting Permissions While Creating (`-m`)

```bash
mkdir -m 755 myfolder
```

- Creates `myfolder` with permissions `755` (read & execute for all, write for the owner).

### 5. Checking for Existing Directory (`-v`)

```bash
mkdir -v myfolder
```

- Displays a message confirming the directory was created.

### 6. Avoiding Errors for Existing Directories (`-p`)

```bash
mkdir -p myfolder
```

- Does not return an error if the directory already exists.

## Practical Usage

### 1. Creating a Directory with a Timestamp

```bash
mkdir $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
```

- Creates a directory named with the current date.

### 2. Creating a Directory and Moving into It

```bash
mkdir myproject && cd myproject
```

- Creates `myproject` and immediately navigates into it.

### 3. Creating Multiple Directories with a Pattern

```bash
mkdir project{1..3}
```

- Creates `project1`, `project2`, and `project3`.

## **Beginner Activity: Creating Basic Directories**

### **Objective:** Learn how to create a directory and verify its existence.

### **Steps:**

1. Open a terminal in your Linux environment.
2. Create a new directory called `test_directory` in your home folder:
    
    ```bash
    mkdir test_directory
    ```
    
3. Verify the directory was created using:
    
    ```bash
    ls
    ```
    
4. Navigate into the newly created directory:
    
    ```bash
    cd test_directory
    ```
    
5. Use `pwd` to check your current location.
6. **Challenge:** Try creating another directory inside `test_directory` and navigate into it.

## **Intermediate Activity: Creating Nested Directories and Managing Permissions**

### **Objective:** Learn how to create multiple directories at once and control access permissions.

### **Steps:**

1. Move to your home directory:
    
    ```bash
    cd ~
    ```
    
2. Create a nested directory structure in a single command:
    
    ```bash
    mkdir -p projects/linux/scripts
    ```
    
3. Verify the structure using:
    
    ```bash
    tree projects
    ```
    
    (If `tree` is not installed, use `ls -R projects`.)
4. Change the permissions of the `linux` directory to make it accessible only to the owner:
    
    ```bash
    chmod 700 projects/linux
    ```
    
5. **Challenge:** Attempt to access `projects/linux` as another user (if applicable) and note the result.

## **Advanced Activity: Automating Directory Creation with a Script**

### **Objective:** Use `mkdir` in a script to automate directory creation for projects.

### **Steps:**

1. Create a new script file:
    
    ```bash
    nano create_project_dirs.sh
    ```
    
2. Add the following script to the file:
    
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "Enter project name:"
    read project_name
    mkdir -p ~/projects/$project_name/{docs,src,bin,tests}
    echo "Project structure for '$project_name' has been created."
    ```
    
3. Save and exit (Ctrl + X, then Y, then Enter).
4. Make the script executable:
    
    ```bash
    chmod +x create_project_dirs.sh
    ```
    
5. Run the script and input a project name when prompted:
    
    ```bash
    ./create_project_dirs.sh
    ```
    
6. Check that the project structure was created correctly using `ls -R ~/projects`.
7. **Challenge:** Modify the script to check if the directory already exists before creating it.
